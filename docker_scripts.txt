Download and run
First, download the latest Qdrant image from Dockerhub:

docker pull qdrant/qdrant

Then, run the service:

docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    qdrant/qdrant

Under the default configuration all data will be stored in the ./qdrant_storage directory. This will also be the only directory that both the Container and the host machine can both see.

Qdrant is now accessible:

REST API: localhost:6333
Web UI: localhost:6333/dashboard
GRPC API: localhost:6334
